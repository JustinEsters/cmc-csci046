## About the Course

I am currently teaching data structures at CMC online due to coronavirus.
I've made some modifications to that material to make it suitable for PUST.

**Required Materials:**

1. Linux installation (Ubuntu okay)
1. Python 3.6 or greater

**Learning Objectives:**

Primary objectives:

1. Master the Python programming language
1. Be able to answer the following three questions about an algorithm:
    1. Is it correct?
    1. How much resources does it consume? (time, memory, money, etc.)
    1. Can we do better?

Secondary objectives:

1. Learn basic devops (development operations) and how open source software is developed
    1. Learn basic shell programming
    1. Learn how to develop good automatic test cases for your code
1. Introduction to the mathematics of programming (overlap with discrete math)

**Textbook:**

[Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) by Brad Miller and David Ranum

**Assignments:**

1. Weekly labs (worth 2pts each)
1. Weekly homeworks (worth 10-25 points each)
1. No midterms, 1 open book final (worth approx. 30 points)
1. In total, there will be about 250 points in the class.

## Schedule

We will follow the course lectures for CMC's data structures course.
That course is 4 weeks longer, so I've ~~crossed out~~ the lectures we will not have time to cover below.
(I'll still provide the lectures/materials if you'd like to review these topics yourself.)
